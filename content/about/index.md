# Hi, I'm Dranix!

A student, who is irresistible to find out how computer beep-booping.

#### Some words about myself

Well, there's nothing much to talk about myself, though.

I'm a half-weeb, because I sometimes watch anime, just for fun.

I'm a both Windows and Linux user. Linux is always the best operating system that I loves the most, but it's still somehow not very good for the desktop, where Windows is doing pretty fine. 

#### Where can I contact you?

[Contact me](/contact) page, I think.

#### I have some ideas for this about page...

Make an issue against this website's [repository on Github](https://github.com/Wello6143/wello6143.github.io), or just contact me if you're not a developer.
